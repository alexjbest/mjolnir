<article class="hiddenproof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h5>\(\Leftarrow\) clear, \(\Rightarrow\) let \(U \subset X\) be open affine, \(U = \Spec A\).
            In general if \(B\) is Notherian and \(f \in B\) then \(B_f\) is Noetherian and \(D(f) \cong \Spec B_p\) as schemes.
            Also the \(D(f)\)s form a basis for the topology on \(\Spec B\).
            Thus any open set of \(\Spec B\) can be covered by open affines of the form \(\Spec B_f \) with \(B_f\) Noetherian.
            \(U \cap \Spec B\) can be covered by affine schemes of the form \(\Spec B_f\) with \(B_f \) Noetherian.
            We need to show that if \(\Spec A\) can be covered by sets of the form \(\Spec B\) with \(B\) Noetherian, then \(A\) is Noetherian.
