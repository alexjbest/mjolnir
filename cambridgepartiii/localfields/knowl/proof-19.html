            Lemma 1.1  implies \(\ab\) is non-archimidean.
            Let \(p = \{x\in R : |x| \lt 1\}\), this is a prime ideal.
            Localising at \(R\smallsetminus p\) gives a DVR by Theorem 3.2  this has valuation \(v_p\).
            Take \(\pi \in p \smallsetminus p^2 \) so we can write \(x \in K^*\) as \(x= u\pi^r\) where \(|u|_p = 1\) and \(r\in \ZZ\).
            To prove \(\ab\sim\ab_p\) we need to show that \(|\pi| \lt 1\) (which is true as \(\pi \in p\)) and also that \(|u| = 1\).
            We have \(|u|_p \le 1\) which gives \(u \in S^{-1}R\) so \(u = r/s\) for \(r\in R, s\in R\) we know \(|r| \le 1\) and \(|s| = 1\) so \(|u| \le 1\).
            We can do the same for \(u^{-1}\) to get \(|u| = 1\).
