          WLOG \(V = K^d\) and we will show every norm is equivalent to \(\|\cdot\|_{\sup}\), the proof is via induction on \(d\).
          For \(d = 1\)\(\|v\| = c\|v\|_{\sup}\) for some \(c \gt 0\) and the result is clear.<br>
          For generl \(d\) we let \(e_1,\ldots,e_d\) be the standard basis, so
          \[
            \|x\| = \left\| \sum_{i=1}^d x_ie_i\right\| \le \left(\sum_{i=1}^d \|e_i\|\right)\max_{1\le i\le d}|x_i|.
          \]
          Let \(S = \{v\in V | \|v\|_{\sup} = 1\}\) (the equation  implies that \(\|\cdot\| \colon S\to \RR_{\ge 0}\) is continuous w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|_{\sup}\) but we don't know \(S\) is compact).<br>
          We now claim that there exists \(\epsilon \gt 0\) s.t. \(\|x\| \gt \epsilon \) for all \(x\in S\).
          To see this suppose otherwise, i.e. that there exists a sequence \((x^{(n)})\) in\(S\) with \(\|x^(n) \|\to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\).
          For at least one \(1\le i \le d\)\(\|x^{(n)}\|_{\sup} = |x_i^{(n}|\) for infinitely many \(n\).
          WLOG this is \(i=d\) and we may pass to a subsequence and multiply through by \(\lambda\in K\) with \(|\lambda| = 1\) to ensure \(x_d^{(n)} = 1\) i.e. \(x^{(n)} = y^{(n)} + e_d \) for some \(y^{(n)} \in \langle e_1,\ldots,e_{d-1}\rangle\).
          But as \( x^{(n)} \to 0\) w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|\) we have that \(x^{(n)}\) is Cauchy and hence so is \(y^{(n)}\) w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|\).
          This implies that \(y^{(n)} \to y\) w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|\) (since \(K^{d-1}\) is complete by the induction hypothesis) for some \(y \in \langle e_1,\ldots,e_{d-1}\rangle\) but \(y^{(n)} = x^{(n)} -e_d \to -e_d\) w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|\) therefore \(y = -e_d \not\in \langle e_1,\ldots,e_{d-1}\rangle\) a  contradiction, proving the claim. <br>
          Now let \(x\in V\)\(x\ne 0\) and \(\|\cdot\|_{\sup}=|x_i|\) for some \(1\le i\le d\). 
          \(x/x_i\in S\) son \(\|x/x_i\|\gt \epsilon\) implying \(\|x\|\gt \epsilon |x_i | = \epsilon \|x\|_{\sup}\).
          This together with the above equation give that \(\|\cdot\|\) and \(\|\cdot\|_{\sup}\) are equivalent, \(K\) complete implies that \(V\) is complete w.r.t. \(\|\cdot\|_{\sup}\).
