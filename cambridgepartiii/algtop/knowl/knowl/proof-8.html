              We first define \(\partial\), given \([c] \in H_n(C)\) pick \(b\in B_n\) such that \(\pi(b) = c\).
              Now \(\pi db = d\pi b = dc = 0\) and so \(db = ia\) for some \(a \in A_{n-1}\).
              We have that \(ida = dia = ddb = 0\) and so \(da = 0\) and we can define \(\partial [c] = [a] \in H_{n-1} (A)\). <br>
              We must check that the definition of \(\partial\) does not depend on the choice of \(b\) or \(c\) and also check exactness at each term.
              Here we prove exactness at \(H_n(C)\).
              With notation as above suppose \([c] = \pi_*([x])\) then we can take \(b = x\), \(db = 0\) implying that \(a =0\) and so \(\partial [c] = [a] = 0\).
              We have then that \(\im \pi_* \subset \ker \partial\), so it remains to show that \(\ker \partial\subset \im \pi_*\).
              If \([a] = da',\,a'\in A_n\) we let \(b' = b - i(a')\) then \(d(b') = db - d(ia') = db - i(da') = db - db = 0\).
              Then \([b'] \in H_n(B)\) so \(\pi_*([b']) = [\pi(b')] = [\pi(b) - \pi(i(a'))] = [\pi(b)] = [c]\).
