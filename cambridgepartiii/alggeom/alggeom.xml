        <title>Sheaves</title>

        <p>Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.</p>

        <definition>
          <title>Presheaves</title>
          <statement>A <term>presheaf</term> <m>\F</m> of abelian groups (resp. rings) on <m>X</m> consists of data:
            <ol>
              <li>For every open <m>U \subset X</m> an abelian group (resp. ring) <m>\F(U)</m>.</li>
              <li>For every inclusion of open sets <m>V\subset U</m> a homomorphism called <term>restriction</term>, denoted <m>\rho^U_V\colon \F(U) \to \F(V)</m> such that
                <ol>
                  <li><m>\F(\emptyset) = 0.</m></li>
                  <li><m>\rho^U_U\colon \F(U) \to \F(U)</m> is <m>\id_{\F(U)}</m>.</li>
                  <li>If <m>W \subset V \subset U</m> open then <m>\rho^U_W = \rho^V_W \circ \rho^U_V</m>.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <remark>
          <statement>If <m>\U</m> denotes the category of open sets in <m>X</m> (the morphisms are inclusions) then a presheaf of abelian groups over <m>X</m> is a contravariant functor <m>\F\colon  \U \to \text{Abgp}.</m>
          i.e. an element of <m>\text{Abgp}^{\U^\text{op}}</m>.
          </statement>
        </remark>

        <p>An element <m>s \in \F(U)</m> is called a <term>section</term> of <m>\F</m> over <m>U</m>.
          For <m>s\in \F(U)</m> we denote <m>\rho^U_V(s)</m> by <m>s|_V</m>.
        </p>

        <definition>
          <title>Sheaves</title>
          <statement>
            A presheaf <m>\F</m> on <m>X</m> is a <term>sheaf</term> if it satisfies two further conditions:
            <ol>
              <li>If <m>U</m> is open and has <m>U = \bigcup_i U_i</m> an open cover and if <m>s \in \F(U)</m> is such that <m>s|_{V_i} = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> then <m>s = 0</m>.
                (A presheaf satisfying this condition is called a <term>monopresheaf</term>).
              </li>
              <li>If <m>U = \bigcup_i V_i</m> is an open cover and we have <m>s_i\in \F(V_i)</m> such that <m>\forall i,j\ s_i|_{V_i\cap V_j} = s_j|_{V_i\cap V_j}</m> then there exists <m>s \in \F(U)</m> with <m>s|_{V_i} = s_i</m> for all <m>i</m>.</li>
            </ol>
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <example>
          <statement><m>X</m> a topological space, <m>A</m> any abelian group (resp. ring).
            The constant shead <m>\A</m> determined by <m>A</m> is defined as follows: <m>\A(\emptyset) = \{0\}</m>, for <m>U \ne \emptyset</m> open in <m>X</m> <me>\A(U) = \{\text{locally constant maps }U\to A\},</me> this is an abelian group (resp. ring) under pointwise operations.
            With obvious restriction maps we obtain a sheaf.
            If <m>U \ne \emptyset</m> is open and connected, then <m>\A(U) = A</m>.
            If <m>U</m> an open set whose connected components are open (e.g. in a locally connected topological space <m>X</m>) then the section <m>\A(U)</m> is a direct product of copies of <m>A</m>.
          </statement>
        </example>

        <example>
          <statement>If <m>X</m> is a differentiable (<m>C^\infty</m>) manifold, we can define the sheaf of <m>C^\infty</m>-functions (<m>\RR</m> or <m>\CC</m> valued) on <m>X</m>.
            Which is a sheaf of rings.
            Similarly if <m>X</m> is a complex manifold, we can define a sheaf of holomorphic functions on <m>X</m>.
            In both cases, the sheaf is called the <term>structure sheaf</term> of <m>X</m>, sometimes denoted <m>\cO_X</m>.
          </statement>
        </example>

        <example>
          <statement>For <m>V</m> an (irreducible) variety (affine, projective, quasi-projective).
            We can consider <m>V</m> as a topological space with the Zariski topology.
            For <m>U</m> open in <m>V</m> set <me>\cO_V(U)=\{\text{regular functions on } U\} = \{f\in k(V) \text{ s.t. }f \text{ regular on } U\}.</me>
            This is a sheaf of rings with respect to the Zariski topology, and is known as the <term>structure sheaf</term> for varieties.
            If <m>V</m> is affine we have that <m>\cO_V(V) = k[V]</m>.
          </statement>
        </example>

        <definition>
          <title>Stalks</title>
          <statement>If <m>\F</m> is a presheaf on a topological space <m>X</m> and <m>P\in X</m> we define the stalk <m>\F_P</m> of <m>\F</m> at <m>P</m> to be <m>\varinjlim_{U\ni P} \F(U)</m> i.e. an element of <m>\F_P</m> is represented by a pair <m>(U,s)</m> where <m>U</m> is an open neighbourhood of <m>P</m> and <m>s\in \F(U)</m>, where <m>(U,s)</m> and <m>(V,t)</m> define the same element of <m>\F_P</m> if there exists an open neighbourhood <m>W\ni P</m> with <m>W\subset V\cap U</m> such that <m>s|_W = t|_W</m> the elements <m>s_P</m> of <m>\F_P</m> are called <term>germs</term>.
            If <m>\F</m> is a sheaf of abelian groups or rings then <m>\F_P</m> is an abelian group, ring, etc.
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <example>
          <statement>For the constant sheaf <m>\A</m> associated to <m>A</m> we have <m>\A_P = A</m>.
          </statement>
        </example>

        <example>
          <statement>For <m>X</m> a <m>C^\infty</m> manifold (resp. complex) with structure sheaf <m>\cO_X</m>, the stalk <m>\cO_{X,P}</m> of <m>\cO_X</m> at <m>P\in V</m> consists of germs of <m>C^\infty</m> (resp. holomorphic) functions.
          </statement>
        </example>

        <example>
          <statement>For <m>V</m> (irreducible) affine, projective or quasi-projective variety with structure sheaf <m>\cO_V</m> the stalk at <m>P\in V</m> <m>\cO_{V,P} = \text{ local ring at } P</m> (defined before).
          </statement>
        </example>

        <definition>
          <title>Morphisms of (pre)sheaves</title>
          <statement>If <m>\F</m> and <m>\G</m> are presheaves (resp. sheaves) on <m>X</m> a morphism <m>\Phi\colon \F \to \G</m> consists of homomorphisms <m>\F(U) \xrightarrow{\Phi} \G(U)</m> for all open <m>U</m> such that for <m>V \subseteq U</m> open
            <me>\xymatrix@R+2em@C+2em{
              \F(U) \ar[r]^{\phi(U)} \ar[d]_{\rho^U_V} &amp; \G(U) \ar[d]^{\rho'^U_V} \\
              \F(V) \ar[r]_{\phi(V)} &amp; \G(V)
              }
            </me>
            commutes.
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>A morphism <m>\phi\colon \F \to \G</m> induces a homomorphism <m>\phi_P\colon \F_P \to \G_P</m> for each <m>P</m>, namely <m>\phi_P[(U,s)] = [(U,\phi(U)(s))]</m>, which is well defined.</p>

        <definition>
          <title>Injective and isomorphic sheaf morphisms</title>
          <statement>A morphism <m>\phi\colon \F\to\G</m> of (pre)sheaves is <term>injective</term> if <m>\F(U) \to \G(U)</m> is injective for all open <m>U</m>.
            e.g. sheaves of subgroups or subrings where <m>\F(U) \subseteq \G(U)</m> for all <m>U</m>.
            In this case <m>\F</m> is called a <term>subsheaf</term> of <m>\G</m>.<br />
            A morphism <m>\phi\colon \F \to \G</m> is called an isomorphism if there exists an inverse morphism <m>\chi\colon \G\to\F</m>.
            This is equivalent to <m>\phi(U)\colon \F(U) \to \G(U)</m> being bijective for all <m>U</m> since we can define <m>\chi(U) = \phi(U)^{-1}</m> as the inverse.
          </statement>
        </definition>

        <lemma>
          <statement>Let <m>\phi\colon \F\to\G</m> be a morphism of sheaves then
            <ol>
              <li><m>\phi</m> is injective iff <m>\phi_P\colon \F_P \to \G_P</m> is injective for all <m>P\in X</m>,</li>
              <li><m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism iff <m>\phi_P\colon \F_P \to \G_P</m> is an isomorphism for all <m>P\in X</m>.</li>
            </ol>
          </statement>
          <proof>
            <p>(<m>\Rightarrow</m>) (true for presheaves too).
              <ol>
                <li>Suppose there exists a germ <m>s_P\in\F_P</m> such that <m>\phi_P(s_P) = 0\in \G_P</m>.
                  i.e. there exists an open neighbourhood <m>W \subset U</m> with <m>P\in W</m> such that <m>\phi(U)(s|_W) = 0</m>.
                  So by commutativity <m>\phi(W)(s|_W) = 0</m> but <m>\phi</m> injective implies <m>s|_W = 0</m>.
                </li>
                <li>Clear.</li>
              </ol>
              (<m>\Leftarrow</m>)
              <ol>
                <li>Needs first sheaf condition on <m>\F</m>.
                  If <m>\phi_P</m> injective for all <m>P</m> and <m>U</m> is open in <m>X</m> it remains to prove that <m>\phi(U) \colon \F(U) \to \G(U)</m> is injective.
                  Suppose not and there exists <m>0 \ne s \in \F(u)</m> such that <m>\phi(U)(s) = 0 \in \G(U)</m>.
                  Let <m>s_P</m> denote the germ of <m>s</m> at <m>P \in U</m>, then <m>0 = \phi(U)(s)_P = \phi_P(s_P)</m> for all <m>P\in U</m>.
                  So <m>s_P</m> in <m>\F_P</m> for all <m>P \in U</m>.
                  Hence for all <m>P\in U</m> we have an open neighbourhood <m>U \supset W \ni P</m> such that <m>s|_W = 0</m>.
                  So <m>U</m> is covered by open sets <m>U_\alpha</m> such that <m>s|_{U_\alpha} = 0</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>, which implies that <m>s = 0</m>.
                </li>
                <li><m>\phi(U) \colon \F(U) \to \G(U)</m> is an injection for all open <m>U</m> by the first part, so it remains to prove that it is surjective also.
                  Suppose <m>t \in \G(U)</m> and let <m>t_P\in\G_P</m> be its germ at <m>P\in U</m>.
                  Since <m>\phi_P</m> is surjective we have some <m>s_P\in \F_P</m> such that <m>\phi_P(s_P) = t_P</m>.
                  Now suppose that <m>s_P</m> is represented by a pair <m>(V,s)</m> with <m>P\in V \subseteq U</m> and <m>s\in \F(V)</m>.
                  We then have that <m>t_P</m> is represented by <m>\phi(V)(s)</m>, i.e. <m>(U,t)\sim (V,\phi(V)(s))</m>.
                  Shrinking <m>V</m> we may assume that we have an ope neighbourhood <m>V_P\ni P</m> such that <m>\phi(V)(s)|_{V_P} = t|_{V_P}</m>.
                  In this way we cover <m>U</m> by open sets giving <m>U = = \bigcup_{\alpha} U_\alpha</m> to obtain sections <m>s_\alpha \in\F_\alpha</m> such that <m>\phi(U_\alpha)(s_\alpha) = t|_{U_\alpha}</m>.
                  On the overlaps <m>U_{\alpha\beta} = U_\alpha \cap U_\beta</m> we have <m>\phi(U_{\alpha\beta})(s_\alpha|_{U_{\alpha\beta}}) = t|_{U_{\alpha\beta}} = \phi(U_{\alpha\beta})(s_\beta|_{U_{\alpha\beta}})</m>, therefore the injectivity of <m>\phi(U_{\alpha\beta})</m> gives that <m>s_\alpha|_{U_{\alpha\beta}} = s_\beta|_{U_{\alpha\beta}}</m>.
                  Since <m>\F</m> is a sheaf the <m>s_\alpha</m> patch together to give a section <m>s \in \F(U)</m> wuch that <m>s|_{U_\alpha} = s_\alpha</m> (using the second sheaf condition for <m>\F</m>).
                  But then <m>\phi(U)(s)</m> and <m>t</m> are sections of <m>\G(U)</m> such that <m>\phi(U)(s)|_{U_{\alpha}}  = \phi(U_\alpha)(s_\alpha) = t|_{U_\alpha}</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>.
                  The first sheaf condition for <m>\G</m> now gives that <m>\phi(U)(s) = t</m> as required.

            for <m>U</m> open in <m>Y</m>.
            With the restriction maps coming from <m>\F</m> as <m>V \subset U</m> implies <m>f^{-1}(V)\subset f^{-1}(U)</m>.
            It should be checked that indeed <m>\F</m> being a (pre)sheaf implies <m>f_*\F</m> is a (pre)sheaf.

            A smooth (resp. holomorphic) map of manifolds <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> yields a morphism of <m>\RR</m> (resp. <m>\CC</m>)-algebras <m>f^\#\colon \cO_Y\to f_* \cO_X</m> namely <m>f^\#\colon\cO_Y(U) \to\cO_X(f^{-1}U)</m> given by <m>g\to g\circ f</m> (smooth (resp. holomorphic) functions on <m>Y</m> pullback to ones on <m>X</m>).

            If <m>\Phi\colon V \to W</m> is a morphism of affine varieties then there exists a morphism of locally ringed spaces over <m>k</m> <m>(\phi, \phi^\#)\colon (V, \cO_V) \to (W, \cO_W)</m> given by <m>\phi^\#(g) = g\circ \phi \in \cO_V(\phi^{-1}U)</m> for <m>g\in\cO_W(U)</m>.

          <proof>Suppose <m>V\subseteq \bfA^n,\ W\subseteq\bfA^m</m> let <m>y_j</m> be the <m>j</m>th coordinate function on <m>W</m> and define <m>g_j = f^\#(y_j) \in \cO_V(V) = k[V]</m>.
            Let <m>\phi = (g_1,\ldots,g_m)</m>, this is a morphism <m>V \to \bfA^m</m>.
            Suppose that <m>f(P) = (b_1,\ldots,b_m)</m> for <m>P\in V</m> then <m>y_j - b_j \in m_{W,f(P)}</m> for all <m>j</m> which implies that <m>g_j(P) = b_j</m> for all <m>j</m>.
            Since <m>f^\#</m> is local we have that <m>\phi(P) = f(P)</m> and so <m>\phi \colon V \to W</m> is the same map as <m>f</m> on topological spaces.
            Moreover <m>y_1,\ldots,y_m</m> generate <m>k[V]</m> as a <m>k</m>-algebra and also generate <m>k(W)</m> as a field over <m>k</m>. <todo></todo>
            <m>f^\#(y_j) = g_j = y_j\circ\phi = \phi^\#(y_j)</m> and it follows that <m>f^\# = \phi^\#</m> on any <m>\cO_W(U)</m>.

              Similarly we have the obvious definition for morphisms of <m>\cO_X</m>-modules <m>\phi\colon M \to N</m> (all maps respect the <m>\cO_X</m>-module structure).

            However there is the following technicality:
            If we take the pushforward of an <m>\cO_X</m>-module <m>M</m> under a morphism of ringed spaces <m>(X,\cO_X ) \xrightarrow{\phi}(Y,\cO_Y)</m>.
            The sheaf <m>f_* M</m> is naturally an <m>f_*\cO_X</m>-module via the morphism <m>f^\#\colon \cO_Y \to f_* \cO_X</m> we can consider <m>f_*M</m> as an <m>\cO_Y</m>-module which we denote by <m>\phi_* M</m>.

            We write <m>\psi_{ji}</m> for the map from the <m>i</m>th trivialisation to the <m>j</m>th.
