<li>Needs first sheaf condition on \(\F\).
                  If \(\phi_P\) injective for all \(P\) and \(U\) is open in \(X\) it remains to prove that \(\phi(U) \colon \F(U) \to \G(U)\) is injective.
                  Suppose not and there exists \(0 \ne s \in \F(u)\) such that \(\phi(U)(s) = 0 \in \G(U)\).
                  Let \(s_P\) denote the germ of \(s\) at \(P \in U\), then \(0 = \phi(U)(s)_P = \phi_P(s_P)\) for all \(P\in U\).
                  So \(s_P\) in \(\F_P\) for all \(P \in U\).
                  Hence for all \(P\in U\) we have an open neighbourhood \(U \supset W \ni P\) such that \(s|_W = 0\).
                  So \(U\) is covered by open sets \(U_\alpha\) such that \(s|_{U_\alpha} = 0\) for all \(\alpha\), which implies that \(s = 0\).
                </li>
<li>\(\phi(U) \colon \F(U) \to \G(U)\) is an injection for all open \(U\) by the first part, so it remains to prove that it is surjective also.
                  Suppose \(t \in \G(U)\) and let \(t_P\in\G_P\) be its germ at \(P\in U\).
                  Since \(\phi_P\) is surjective we have some \(s_P\in \F_P\) such that \(\phi_P(s_P) = t_P\).
                  Now suppose that \(s_P\) is represented by a pair \((V,s)\) with \(P\in V \subseteq U\) and \(s\in \F(V)\).
                  We then have that \(t_P\) is represented by \(\phi(V)(s)\), i.e. \((U,t)\sim (V,\phi(V)(s))\).
                  Shrinking \(V\) we may assume that we have an ope neighbourhood \(V_P\ni P\) such that \(\phi(V)(s)|_{V_P} = t|_{V_P}\).
                  In this way we cover \(U\) by open sets giving \(U = = \bigcup_{\alpha} U_\alpha\) to obtain sections \(s_\alpha \in\F_\alpha\) such that \(\phi(U_\alpha)(s_\alpha) = t|_{U_\alpha}\).
                  On the overlaps \(U_{\alpha\beta} = U_\alpha \cap U_\beta\) we have \(\phi(U_{\alpha\beta})(s_\alpha|_{U_{\alpha\beta}}) = t|_{U_{\alpha\beta}} = \phi(U_{\alpha\beta})(s_\beta|_{U_{\alpha\beta}})\), therefore the injectivity of \(\phi(U_{\alpha\beta})\) gives that \(s_\alpha|_{U_{\alpha\beta}} = s_\beta|_{U_{\alpha\beta}}\).
                  Since \(\F\) is a sheaf the \(s_\alpha\) patch together to give a section \(s \in \F(U)\) wuch that \(s|_{U_\alpha} = s_\alpha\) (using the second sheaf condition for \(\F\)).
                  But then \(\phi(U)(s)\) and \(t\) are sections of \(\G(U)\) such that \(\phi(U)(s)|_{U_{\alpha}}  = \phi(U_\alpha)(s_\alpha) = t|_{U_\alpha}\) for all \(\alpha\).
                  The first sheaf condition for \(\G\) now gives that \(\phi(U)(s) = t\) as required.
