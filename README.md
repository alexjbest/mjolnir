Warwick University Lecture Note Repository

What is it then?
The aim is to provide a repository of typeset lecture notes for as many Warwick University modules as possible that do not have official lecture notes availiable.
Ambitious huh?

Getting the files
=================

There are a few ways you can get the files depending on how geeky you are:
- Visit http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~csulbj/ and click the links to the pdf files there.
- Just save the raw LaTeX source from github and then compile it yourself.
- Clone the repo on your machine and help maintain the notes!
