Welcome to My Jejune but Open Lecture Note of Interest Repository (it took me at least half an hour to come up with that but acronym hey, Norse hammers are awesome). The idea is that this will contain typed lecture notes for courses/lectures that I get around to typing up.

The files are currently organised by institution and year of study and then by course.
